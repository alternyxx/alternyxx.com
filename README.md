A portfolio site utilising webgpu.
Web-based components are made with vite + react + typescript.
Feedback is much appreciated! ^^
If you'd like to not see the mess of code, stay away from the repo...

# Plans
Make stage 2 a blahaj, im planning to write a python script to do that
Switch from vite to nextJs so the site actually gets indexed
