A portfolio site utilising webgpu.    
Feedback is much appreciated! ^^  
If you'd like to not see the mess of code, stay away from the repo...

# Details
As this was my first ever web project, tailwind wasn't used and I rolled with  
plain css. So, the typography imo was really bad.  
I initially wanted to migrate this project to next js but seeing how I don't  
really need any of the features next provides, might as well not.  
The assets are stored not on fetched because api requests fail most of the time  
and its kinda hard to code something which you literally can't see.

# Structure
If you're interested in the code for shaders, they're in src/components/Canvas/shaders.
