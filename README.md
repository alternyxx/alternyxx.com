# [alternyxx.com](https://alternyxx.com/)
A portfolio site utilising webgpu.
Web-based components are made with vite + react + typescript.
Feedback is much appreciated! ^^
If you'd like to not see the mess of code, stay away from the repo...

# Plans
Make headings, subheadings and general text utility classes instead of individual ones
Make stage 2 a blahaj, im planning to write a python script to do that
Switch from vite to nextJs so the site actually gets indexed
