A portfolio site for myself. Vite-React app that utilises webgpu. 
I plan to write blogs, showcase what I've done as well as provide some tools on this website.  
Feedback for both the code and the design is much appreciated! ^^

# Details
~~As this was my first ever web project, tailwind wasn't used and I rolled with  
plain css. So, the typography imo was really bad.~~  
<sub>
    SLOWLY INTEGRATING TAILWIND V4 INTO THE PROJECT!!!
    but it probably wont be able to replace the css files of some components
</sub>
  
I initially wanted to migrate this project to nextjs but seeing how I don't  
really need any of the features next provides, might as well not.  
  
The assets are stored not on fetched because api requests fail most of the time 
for me.

If you're interested in the code for shaders, they're in src/components/Canvas/shaders.
